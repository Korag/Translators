# Translators

The repository consists of several projects, all of which are related to the issue of translators:

* RegexForm -> a form based on React, which uses REGEX queries to validate the data entered
* FileLineRegexRecognizer -> program using REGEX to identify the file format to be read and thus correct mapping to the object (.csv,json,xml)
* Lexer -> lexer with grammar based on conditional instructions
* DFALexer -> lexer based on DFA (Deterministic finite automaton)
* Parser -> parser, which with the help of DFALexer converts the inputted notation into RPN (reverse Polish notation)
